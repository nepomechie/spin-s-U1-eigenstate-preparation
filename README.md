# Spin-s $U(1)$-eigenstate preparation - arXiv:2601.14513

Cirq code for preparing arbitrary spin-s $U(1)$-eigenstates ($s$=1/2, 1, 3/2, ...)

As examples, the preparation of the following states is considered:

$\bullet$ AKLT ground state (PBC)

$\bullet$ spin-s Dicke states

$\bullet$ spin-s Bethe states (eigenstates of integrable spin-s XXX Hamiltonians with PBC)

The preparation of $U(1)$-eigenstates with random real or complex amplitudes is also illustrated.

This code can be run on Google colab  ( https://colab.google/ ) or locally, using python (3.12.1) and cirq (1.5.0)
