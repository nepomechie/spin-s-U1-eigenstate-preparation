# Spin-s-U1-eigenstate-preparation
Cirq code for preparing arbitrary spin-s U(1)-eigenstates

As examples, the preparation of the following states is considered:

AKLT ground state (PBC)

spin-s Dicke states

spin-s Bethe states (eigenstates of integrable spin-s XXX Hamiltonians with PBC)

The preparation of U(1)-eigenstates with random real or complex amplitudes is also illustrated.
